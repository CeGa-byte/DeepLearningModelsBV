# DeepLearningModelsBV

Different Deep Learning Models, namely UNet, ResUNet and R2UNet. Pretrained Models for patches of size 64x64. Loaded Data must be images (.png, .jpg ...) and should all be the same size ideally, otherwise must be cropped. To only use a pretrained model, use UsePretrainedModel.py and specify which model should be used. Parameters must be set according to the used model. Initial parameters are for the R2UNet, the best model out of all three.
